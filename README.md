# Robot Vision - Chrome Extension

Give a Chrome (or Chromebook) ultimate control over a host machine
by installing this simple extension designed to interact with a targeted
machine.

Robot Vision manifests itself in the form of a [page action][pa] or a little
icon next to the vision view url: `*://*/robot-vision.html`.

Click on the icon, and you should gain full control of the machine.
